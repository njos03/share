<h3>Problem 2 : Maximum Price Drop</h3>
<p><b>Problem Statement:</b>
Given the daily price of onions per 10kgs, find the max price drop onions experienced. Price drop is defined as a decrease in price from a given day to a day in the future. What is the time complexity & space complexity of your algorithm? Is this the optimal solution?
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b> For the onion prices: P = [21, 19, 24, 32, 30, 31, 34, 31, 31, 26, 29], the max price drop was from $34 to $26 a price drop of $8.<br>
    <b>NOTE:</b>  that maxDrop is not necessarily the difference between minPrice and maxPrice. For instance, in the above example minPrice=19, maxPrice=34, but the onion's price did not fall from 19 to 34, rather it increased from 19 to 34. So it does not constitute a maxDrop.
